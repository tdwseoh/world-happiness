This project takes its data from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) by jaina on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/world-happiness-report-2024-yearly-updated).

The data comes from the World Happiness Report, where data was collected through surveys in different countries. We focused on the study of happiness and the most relevant factors. Variables such as year, positive effect, negative effect, etc. were left out and not part of the analysis.
