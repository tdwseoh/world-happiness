My name is Thomas Seoh, and I am becoming a student at [Iroquois Ridge High School](https://irs.hdsb.ca/) in this September. Here is my [Github account](https://github.com/tdwseoh) where all my other projects are listed, and here is my [email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&to=tommyseoh@gmail.com&tf=cm) where you are free to contact me.

This project explores the various factors that defines happiness levels. The participants were asked to measure their level of happiness on a scale from 1-10, 1 being the lowest, and 10 being the highest. Here is the [Github repository](https://github.com/tdwseoh/world-happiness).

This project was created as a part of [Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
